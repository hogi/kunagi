DESCRIPTION

    Kunagi is a free web-based tool for integrated project management and
    collaboration based on Scrum. It is integrated, allowing users to manage
    their complete project using only one tool. For that purpose, Scrum is
    supplemented by a selection of other best practices to cover all project
    management needs. The tool's range provides not only the basis for all
    Scrum practices (like product, sprint backlogs and impediment list), but
    also offers management of additional important project data (like non-
    functional requirements, risks, files, issues and bugs), as well as
    several features for ease of use (featuring a project dashboard, an
    interactive whiteboard for the current sprint and planning poker for
    estimation) and team collaboration (including comments for every entity,
    a wiki and a discussion board).

    Kunagi is aimed at, but not limited to, software projects. The light
    nature of agile project management allows for use by both professionals
    and non-professionals, causing minimal overhead to the project. Therefore,
    it is also suitable for small projects done by virtual teams, i. e. teams
    that are scattered across the world.

    Using Kunagi's web interface, it is possible to access project related
    data from anywhere. Despite being an online application, the powerful
    interface is built to keep up with the flexibility of desktop software,
    as it makes use of asynchronous technology employing the Google Web
    Toolkit (GWT).

    Last, but not least, it is important to us that the tool helps people get
    their work done. We understand that it is therefore important for the tool
    to be not only suitable for project management, but also be accessible,
    offer a coherent work flow and be fun to use. For this reason, we have been
    using Kunagi for it's own project management, once it was ready to provide
    sufficient functionality for our needs. Moreover, after the tool's release,
    we will provide additions, enhancements and updates on a regular basis.
