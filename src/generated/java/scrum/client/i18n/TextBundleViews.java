In order for this to be possible, the Product Owner\nneeds to provide a sufficient description and explanation of the Story. Once Stories\nare pulled to a Sprint, they may not be changed any further. Therefore, the Product Owner\nshould always be present for estimation and explain the Stories to the team (and adjust\nthe it\'s description and scope if necessary).</p>\n\n<p>As a rule of thumb, there should be enough detailed and estimated Stories for the\nnext two to three Sprints. Putting too much detail into low priotized Stories should\nbe avoided, as details are likely to change in the future.</p>\n\n<h3>The Team\'s Velocity</h3>\n<p>The Velocity history and average Velocity values show how many Story Points the Team\nwas able to complete in past Sprints and on average. By adjusting the anticipated Velocity\nvalue, the Product Owner and other project members can project an approximation of what\nwill be completed in the following Sprints.
