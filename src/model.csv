It contains Stories that describe desired product features. Furthermore, the\nStories are priotized: the more important the feature the higher in the Product Backlog\nit is placed.</p>\n\n<h3>Team select Stories during Sprint Planning</h3>\n<p>During Sprint Planning Meetings, the Team picks Stories from the top (and only the\ntop) of the Product Backlog and commits to implement them during the upcoming Sprint.\nBy placing the features he wants to see implemented next on top of the Product Backlog,\nthe Product Owner can decide the direction of the project.</p>\n\n<h3>Estimating the Product Backlog</h3>\n<p>Before the Team can start working on Stories, Team Members have to estimate them\nrelative to each other (i. e. a Story estimated with 2 points presumably takes twice\nas much effort as a 1 point Story). In order to be able to do so, the Product Owner\nneeds to provide a sufficient description and explanation of the Story. Once stories\nare pulled to a Sprint, they may not be changed anymore. Therefore, the Product Owner\nshould alway be present for estimation and explain the Stories to the team (and adjust\nthe entity if neccessary).</p>\n\n<p>As a rule of thumb, there should be enough detailed and estimated Stories for the\nnext two to three Sprints. Putting too much detail into low priotized Stories should\nbe avoided, as details are likely to change in the future.</p>\n\n<h3>The Team\'s Velocity</h3>\n<p>The Velocity history and avarage Velocity values show how many Story Points the Team\nwas able to complete in past Sprints and on avarage. By adjusting the anticipated Velocity\nvalue, the Product Owner and other project members can project an approximation of what\nwill be completed in the following Sprints. It also helps the Team to decide, how many\nStories they can commit to during the Sprint Planning Meeting.</p>"
